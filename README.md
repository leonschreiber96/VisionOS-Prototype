# Prototype for Chess Game Viewing Experience in VisionOS
This project explores the development of a chess tournament spectating tool for VisionOS, designed to provide a more immersive and customizable viewing experience. The application features both a traditional 2D board view—similar to popular platforms like Lichess—and an interactive 3D chessboard that users can freely move, rotate, and place in their environment. Additionally, the app includes a MultiView experience, allowing users to watch multiple perspectives of the event, such as player and commentator views, simultaneously.

Overall, the project has been largely successful. The core prototype is functional, and the main features work as intended. However, some aspects remain unfinished, and a few bugs still need to be addressed. Features like real-time move analysis, enhanced UI/UX, and deeper chess engine integration were considered but not fully implemented due to time constraints. Despite these limitations, the project demonstrates the potential of VisionOS for interactive chess spectating and opens up interesting possibilities for future development.

## Setup
In order to reduce the workload to a manageable amount, a functional backend has not been implemented. All displayed games are either prerecorded or automatically generated by us and video files have been used instead of an actual live streaming solution.

Therefore you need to **download the video files** before running the application. You can find them on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PsUr5xNoXnkwZUveHdFbdehnsGkAze0O?usp=sharing).

Once you have downloaded the video files, put them in the folder `Videos` in the root directory of the project.

The application should then be able to run from xCode without any issues in the VisionOS simulator or on a real device.

## Usage  

1. **Main Menu**  
   - Upon launching the application, you'll see a scrollable list of available chess games.  
   - Select a game to start watching. Live games with video streams are marked accordingly.  
   - The game previews update in real time, even without selecting a specific game.  

2. **2D Game Information View**  
   - After selecting a game, the interface presents a **2D chessboard** displaying the current game state.  
   - The **left and right panels** show player details and move history.  
   - Below the board, a **timeline slider** lets you scrub through the game history like a video.  
   - A **play/pause button** allows automatic progression through the moves.  
   - Two main action buttons:  
     - **"3D aktivieren"**: Switch to the **3D chessboard** experience.  
     - **"Livestream starten"**: Activate the live video stream (if available).  

3. **3D Chess Board View**  
   - Tapping **"3D aktivieren"** places a virtual chessboard in your physical space.  
   - The **board is interactive**: you can move, rotate, and resize it.  
   - It displays the current game state at activation, but **does not update in real-time** due to known sync issues.  

4. **Video View / MultiView Experience**  
   - If a game has multiple video streams, you can select different perspectives (e.g., **commentator, player view, official broadcast**).  
   - Video playback is **synchronized** across different streams and with the game’s move progression.  
   - MultiView allows you to watch multiple streams at once, offering an enhanced spectating experience.
